# reservation-php-plugin
A small php app/plugin (whatever you'd like to call it) that allows users to make reservations. It checks to make sure there hasn't been a time already inserted into the database at the requested time, then creates a reservation. PHP and SQL. It still needs some validation for the name and party size but other than that it works perfect!
